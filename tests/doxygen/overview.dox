 *
 * @section sec_Overview Overview
 *
 * Ja Rule is an open source DMX512 / RDM stack for PIC32 MCUs. It contains
 * code to function as either an DMX / RDM controller (transmitter) or as an
 * DMX receiver / RDM responder.
 *
 * @section sec_Features Features
 *
 * @subsection sec_features_controller USB to DMX / RDM Controller
 *  - Configurable transmit timing parameters, including:
 *    - Break duration
 *    - Mark duration
 *    - RDM response Timeout / Broadcast response timeout
 *  - Response timing information, including:
 *    - Break time
 *    - Mark time
 *    - Response delay
 *
 * @subsection sec_features_responder DMX512 / RDM Receiver
 *  - The ability to simulate many different types of @ref rdm_models.
 *    This allows RDM controllers to be tested without having access to a large
 *    number of devices. The code can act as:
 *    - An LED Driver
 *    - A moving light
 *    - A sensor only device (No DMX footprint)
 *  - Configurable RDM response delay, with an option to introduce jitter
 *  - Identify & Mute status indicators.
 *  - RGB Pixel control using SPI (LPD8806 only for now).
 *
 * @subsection sec_features_common Common
 *  - \ref usb_logger, with adjustable log levels.
 *  - Extensive @ref unit_testing.
 *
 * @section sec_Platforms Supported Platforms
 *
 * This code is targeted at the PIC32 series MCUs. It uses the parts of the
 * Harmony framework, so it won't work on other platforms without some
 * porting effort.
 *
 * @section sec_Terminology Terminology

 * @section sec_GettingStarted Getting Started
 *
 * See the \ref reference_design for the necessary hardware. Once you have the
 * hardware, the \ref development_env page explains how to get started building
 * the firmware.
