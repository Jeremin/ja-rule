 * @brief Tips on working with MPLAB X & Harmony
 *
 * [TOC]
 *
 * @section dev_overview Overview
 *
 * This page describes how to setup
 * <a href="http://www.microchip.com/mplabx/">MPLAB X</a> as a development
 * environment. MPLAB X can have some quirks which can trip up first time users.
 *
 * @section dev_harmony Harmony
 *
 * <a href="http://www.microchip.com/mplabharmony/">Harmony</a> is Microchip's
 * hardware abstraction & middleware libraries. With the exception of the USB
 * code, we use only the lower level hardware abstraction libraries (typically
 * PLIB_*). Harmony is still fairly new and after examining some of the code, I
 * (Simon) have concerns about code quality.
 *
 * MPLAB X comes with a
 * <a href="https://microchip.wikidot.com/harmony:mhc-installation">Harmony
 * Configurator Plugin (MHC)</a>, which auto-generates the
 * boiler plate code from a Harmony configuration. Due to Java versioning
 * issues, I haven't been able to get the the MHC plugin to work on Mac OS,
 * but the but the good news is that unless you're adding a new module
 * dependency, you don't need MHC and can simply use the generated files that
 * are checked into the repo.
 *
 * When used with Harmony, the design of the MPLAB X build / configuration
 * system makes it difficult to move a project's directory to a new location on
 * the filesystem. In fact, by default, a project's configurations.xml file
 * uses relative paths!
 *
 * This project is set up to assume Harmony 1.02 is installed in
 * /opt/microchip/harmony/v1_02 . If this is not the case on your system you
 * have two options:
 *
 *  - Add a symlink from /opt/microchip/harmony/v1_02 pointing to the
 *    installation path on your system.
 *  - Edit all the project configurations files to fix the path. I don't
 *    recommend this option as it will result in large diffs when you try to
 *    merge your changes later.
 *
 * @section dev_build Building
 *
 * First of all, read the
 * <a
 * href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/50002027C.pdf">MPLAB X
 * Getting Started Guide</a>. From within MPLAB X, choose File -> Open Project,
 * and then select the firmware/ja-rule.X file. Once the project has loaded,
 * you can perform a build (Run -> Build Project) and program your device.
